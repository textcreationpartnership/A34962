            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Guiſian</hi> Leaguers in <hi>France</hi> having ſworn their Aſſociations and Leagues (which they blaſphemouſly termed, <hi>The Confraternities of the Holy Ghoſt)</hi> and in 1588. having tormented and vexed the Dukedom of <hi>Bovillon</hi> with their troubleſom Military Suitors, The principal of the Pack aſſembled at <hi>Nancy</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where there was great conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation held how they might advance themſelves, and overthrow the King. There they agreed to preſent certain Articles to the King, which they would have him agree to, and thoſe were ſuch as tended to the utter deſtruction of the King and the Ancient Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſafety of themſelves. Firſt, They reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the King to joyn more nearly with the League. 2. To eſtabliſh the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition.</hi> 3. To put ſuch Caſtles and ſtrong Townes into their hands, as they ſhould name unto him. The King conſidering how wonderfully they did dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Crown and Dignity, and that they tended directly to the weakning of himſelf, and ſtrengthning of the League, would by no means be induced to condeſcend unto them. And as the Leaguers ſought by ſuch devices to weaken the King, ſo they would not be quiet till the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were both diſpatcht out of the way; the latter whereof they murthered, but the firſt for the time eſcaped. <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the principal Head of thoſe Monſters, had in the mean time cauſed ſuch infamous rumors to be raiſed of the Kings Actions, and by ſecret practiſes had ſo diſgrac'd him among his ſubjects, that he was almoſt grown into contempt with the Commonalty, and was counted no body in compariſon of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> who knowing that he had ſtollen away the peoples hearts from the King, away poſtes he to <hi>Paris,</hi> and notwithſtanding the King had truly miſtruſted his miſchievous deſigns againſt his perſon, and therefore commanded him not to come upon pain of his diſpleaſure, and being lookt upon as a Traitor, and the Author of all thoſe miſeries wherewith the Land was ſo incumbred at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yet he not regarding the Meſſage, followed the Meſſenger cloſe at his heels, and was almoſt at <hi>Paris</hi> as ſoon as he; and not long after went very confidently to ſee the King, and with all humble reverence with his knee to the ground, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him; but the King being diſpleaſed with his coming, frowned on him: He ſeeing that, ſtays not long at Court, but into the City runs he, and by his and his Companies inſtigations, the City roſe up in Armes, and down they went to the <hi>Louvre</hi> to take the King, either alive or dead; which he ſeeing, and having not forces to reſiſt ſuch a rabble, determined to leave the <hi>Louvre,</hi> at the perſwaſions of ſundry his moſt faithful Councellors, who adviſed him to give place to that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Rebellion, and to ſeek his ſafety ſome other where, and ſo incontinently he went from <hi>Paris.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Guiſe</hi> conceiving that the King would ſeek to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of ſo great an indignity offered to his perſon, forthwith ſeized upon the Arſenal, and his Treaſure, removed <hi>Perrenſe</hi> the Provoſt of the Merchants there, from his Office, and the reſt of the chiefeſt Officers which he knew to be affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the King, and placed ſuch as were the moſt factious and ſeditious Leaguers in their rooms; wrote ſundry Letters to his friends abroad, and to the principal Towns, requiring them to joyn with him, and be in a readineſs when he ſhould have need. When he had taken this courſe for himſelf and his friends, he wrote
<pb facs="tcp:65994:3"/> Letters to the King to diſguiſe all his Actions, and to perſwade him that he had no evil meaning againſt his Majeſty, but had always been, and ſtill remained his moſt dutiful Subject, and therefore beſought the King to be his Gracious Lord, and to accept of him as his moſt faithful and loyal Subject; whoſe damnable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and villanous practiſes had their juſt reward given them ſoon after, by ſome of the Kings ſervants, in their ſetting upon and ſlaying him. But yet having left others of his Leaguing Conſpirators behinde him, men of the ſame trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Regicidian Principles with himſelf, they never left contriving and hatching of miſchief, till their murthering ends were accompliſhed in <hi>James Clement</hi> (the <note place="margin">See the mutability of <hi>France.</hi>

He that ſhall well mark this Breviate of the Leaguing Story, and conſider with me of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe (whom ſome are pleaſed to call <hi>The long Parliament)</hi> how after they were once got into their Den, and the King had unfortunately Enacted their Continuance, they began to preſent their Nineteen deſtructive Propoſitions to His Majeſty, utterly derogatory to His Crown and Dignity, That all ſuch as they were pleaſed to miſcall <hi>Delinquents</hi> and diſliked, ſhould be put out of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               </gap> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſaying, <hi>No Biſhops, no Biſhops, no Popiſh Lords,</hi> and ſo audaciouſly too, that they ſet a Bill upon <hi>Whitehall</hi>-gate, to give the people notice that it was to be let; that the King was thereupon perſwaded to leave the place, and give way to that popular Commotion, and did leave it accordingly. How after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they raiſed an Army to ſend againſt Him, ſeized upon his Treaſury, as well as <hi>Militia,</hi> and ordered it which way they pleaſed themſelves. How they remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sir <hi>Richard Gourney</hi> then Lord Major of <hi>London</hi> from his Office, and put in a fiery perſecutor of the Loyal Clergy, (whoſe name, as one ſaith, ſhould more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">Iſaac Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington.</note> have been <hi>Julian)</hi> in his place; as well as others who they knew, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be affectionate to the King and his Legal Cauſe, and placed others of the moſt factious and ſeditious Covenanting Extirpaters in their rooms. How they wrote their Letters to the French Proteſtants abroad, and ſent their Agents into all parts of the Nation at home, deſiring the one, and requiring the other to joyn with and aſſiſt them. How they ſet up a Diſciplinarian Inquiſition among us, that caſt out more Miniſters in three or four years, then all the Biſhops had done in fourſcore years before. How before, and after all this, they wrote their Letters, and ſent their printed, demonſtrating, declaratory Knacks to the King, to diſguiſe their actions, That they had no ill meaning againſt His Majeſty, but had been, and ſtill remained his dutiful and loyal Subjects. How yet by their leaguing together, and proſpering in their wickedneſs, they came at laſt to a peerleſs act of Regicide, of murthering their Sovereign before His own Palace windows, Shall quickly and eaſily perceive, that they were ſworn Leaguers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one and the ſame Cauſe of Extirpating Reformation, and Covenanted Rebellion, and yet both hypocritically pretending their Loyalty and Allegiance, which manifeſts the Serpents art in beguiling people into the ſnares of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and into the ways of impiety and profaneneſs, and then ſhowing his ſervants the way to delude others, to diſguiſe their Villanies with the ſhew of Godlineſs;
<pb facs="tcp:65994:3"/> and their ſeditious actions with the vizard of faithful Obedience and Subjection; for there is no more difference between our <hi>Covenanters</hi> here, and their <hi>Deer</hi> Leaguing <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as to the main end and ſcope of their Leaguing Deſigns, then there is between <hi>Guy Faux</hi> with his Myne and dark Lanthorn, and <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and his execrable Confederates in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall; both whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions we know well enough, was clearly the Murther of Kings, though upon different grounds. The firſt endeavoring to blow up the Father for being too much an Enemy to the Popiſh Ribaldry, and Maſſing Trinckets; The latter actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cutting off the Son, becauſe they thought him in their cauterized conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be a Popiſh Tyrant: but murther we ſee was the aim of both.</p>
            <p>The world (ſaith <note n="a" place="margin">See his Survey of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded holy diſcipline. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft)</hi> now adays is ſet all upon Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Everyman almoſt is of their humour, which thought ſcorn that any ſhould be lifted up above the Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16 1. <hi>Crofton</hi> at leaſt hath wedded himſelf to their murmuring fancy for Eccleſiaſtical parlty, and is very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his confuſed thoughts of it, or elſe we ſhould certainly have never found him affronting his Epiſcopal Antagoniſt, with his Jangling Diſcourſe of Falſhood and Sedition; more particularly aſſerting this palpable whimſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the general current of Venerable Antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> That <note n="b" place="margin">See p. 25. of his book.</note>

Its very ſtrange to me I muſt needs ſay, that an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian ſhould not know what he wrote, at the ſame time he wrote it, better then one of his Juniors at many hundred years diſtance, that ſhould at that time point blanck affirm, That what he ſaid was falſe; but when men are reſolved once to have their wills, no Truth nor Hiſtory muſt dare to controul them, for fear of being taxed of ſpeaking untruths: But ſeeing its an Affirmation without proof, 'tis but anſwering No, to his Ay, and then where is he?

               <hi>I would Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>would own Dr.</hi> Saunderſon <hi>as his Dictator in the nature of an Oath, he ſhould not then ſo much need the Dictates of little Maſter</hi> Crofton.

I wonder what he can get by his Citation of ſuch a Reverend Prelates Works? What profit or advantage is there in thoſe learned Writings, for the upholding of his Covenanting Spell? The Reaſons of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> declares him to be a perſon of admirable parts, and himſelf to be a grand Antagoniſt againſt their ſacred Covenant. The Reverend Prelate cited by that faithful Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt Mr. <hi>Roger L'eſtrange,</hi> in his <hi>Holy Cheat,</hi> tell us, <hi>That no man can binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>

That a part of the Two Houſes (who themſelves were but part of a Parliament) can lawfully, <hi>(i. e.</hi> by the Laws of God or this Land) order and change the Affairs of the Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:65994:4"/> thruſt out, and put in what, and whom they pleaſe, without the Kings conſent, the learned Dictates of that excellent Biſhop, clearly proves the nullity of the Covenant, and the rottenneſs and weakneſs of Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi>'s Dictates; how impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſoever they are uſhered in with his <hi>I deny,</hi> and <hi>I averr,</hi> and ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his brother, the Scotch Confuter of the Learned Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> having affirmed, He took no Oathes, but thoſe appointed by Law. <hi>Crofton</hi> tells him, <note n="c" place="margin">Page 63.</note> 
               <hi>He might reckon the</hi> Covenant <hi>to be of this nature.</hi> And why ſo? Pray Reader, do but obſerve his pitiful reaſon; <hi>for the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by the Petition of Right, the legal appointment of an Oath:</hi> And what then? I cannot but laugh methinks at his folly, and wonder how he keeps his proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes in his noſe, how he leads them by the noſe to believe his fooleries to be unanſwerable! The Petition of Right deſired no Oath might be impoſed upon the people of this Land, but by Act of Parliament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant impoſed by an illegal Ordinance made by a part of a part of a Parliament, is appointed by Law. What a <hi>Non ſequitur</hi> is here? What an illerate Dolt as to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> have we got here? He might as truly argue thus: The Petition of Right declared no Oath to be lawful, but what ſhould be framed and impoſed by Authority of Parliament: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Engagement</hi> made by a part of one, to be <note place="margin">Qui ſemel modeſtiae fines tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilierit, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por et ut ſit gnavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi> Page 182.</note> true and faithful to the Commonwealth, without a King or Houſe of Lords, is of the nature of thoſe Oathes appointed by Law. What the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, will be eaſily perceived in the ſubſequent Diſcourſe, wherein you will finde the Opinions of the Reverend Judges, and Learned Sages of the Land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, more a great deal to be minded then <hi>Ipſe Dixits,</hi> then the Chymae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Dictates of little Mr. <hi>Crofton;</hi> who, what he wants in knowledge, profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplies with a petty large meaſure of confidence.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop having ſpoken of what happy days there were before the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant came, <hi>Sure</hi> (ſaith <note n="d" place="margin">Pa. 53</note> 
               <hi>Crofton) thoſe happy days were not real, but ſeeming.</hi> And why were they ſeeming? <hi>For the Covenant</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>doth naturally make for what is truly good.</hi> What man? The Covenant naturally make for what is truly good? What, have you eaten <hi>ſhame,</hi> and drunk after it? Truly good? Sure the goodneſs that is in it, is not real, but ſeeming; for the Serpent and your party laid their noddles ſo together, that they would be ſure it ſhould tend to nothing but to raiſe ſedition in the State, and diviſions and ſub-diviſions in the Church, for the Enlargement of the kingdom of your Grand-father the <hi>Pope.</hi> I perceive a lie will not choak theſe men; but a <hi>Surplice</hi> and a <hi>Tippet</hi> will make their ſtomachs wamble. The happy days we enjoyed (before the devil began to appear in the likeneſs of an Angel of light, and ſent forth his ſacred Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to trap people in his deluſions) was the envy of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and glory of our Engliſh Nation, and an everlaſting Monument of a gracious Monarch, and made evident in the vaſt maſs of Treaſure, which was ſo profuſely ſpent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the maintenance of an horrid and odious Rebellion againſt His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, and ſwearing this truly evil Covenant, in proſecution thereof; which though it was impoſed by <note n="e" place="margin">

And upon ſuch Enquiry, I found it not at all to portend any good to this Nation; and by an impartial Search into the genuine fruits, and bloody villanous effects thereof (which as Springs from that venemous Fountain, have run forth over the Nation,) I finde that it deſerved rather to have been buried like <hi>Corah</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, in everlaſting oblivion and forgetfulneſs (except it were for a deteſtation and perfect abhorrency of it) then to be revived again as an <hi>Achan</hi> amongſt us, to involve and keep us ſtill in blood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: I ſpeak not this out of paſſion or partiality, but out of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of the evil matter contained in it, part of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Preface whereof ſounds very ſtrangely in mine ears, where they tell us, <hi>That according to the commendable practice of theſe Kingdoms in former times, and Gods people in other Nations, they have reſolved to enter into a Solemn League and Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>§. 7. I have read many of the Leaguers indeed exclaim againſt the Royaliſts, for aſſerting, That the Covenant tended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the King.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65994:12"/> when the Jews crucified our Savior, it was out of a pretended tenderneſs to the glory of God, and when our Engliſh-Jewiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres had murthered their lawful Sovereign, it was meerly (as they pretended) for the advancement of Chriſts kingdom; but that ſuch actions as either of thoſe, concerned either the glory of God, or the advancement of his Sons kingdom, is onely a demonſtration of the Aſſertors ſtrong deluſions; for it plainly intimates unto us, <note n="e" place="margin">See the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, p. 121.</note>

Did not that war (as all wars do) tend to impoveriſh and oppreſs the Kingdom? Was not this League ſworn to carry it on, and not to leave off <hi>(whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give themſelves to a deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, or neutrality in this cauſe</hi> of rebellion) till they had fulfilled their miſcheivous traiterous ends? Can then that Covenant which binds people (as this certainly did and doth) to continue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyling of a Nation or Kingdom in blood, confuſion, perjury and Rebellion, concern ſo much <hi>the good of it?</hi> Can that which ſtirs up people to purſue the impoveriſhing, taxing, and inſlaving of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (for whither did the Rebelling and riſing up in Arms, and ſwearing men to continue therein tend, but to that?) be affirmed by any except Frantick bedlamers to concern <hi>the good and benefit of it?</hi> And laſtly <hi>for the honor of the King,</hi> (for he and his honor are put at the fag end of all in this perfidious League) I further again Quaere, Is it for the honor of the King to have his ſubjects rebel againſt him? Is it for the happineſs of the King and his Poſterity, to have all his Aſſiſtants and Adherents deſtroyed, as much as their fellow-ſubjects can, under the black falſe notion of <hi>Evil Councellors</hi> and <hi>Malignants?</hi> Did not the Covenant binde the takers to ſuch things as thoſe? Let them deny it with truth if they can.

If they ſay no, then a pack of thieves, who lye in wait for to ſpoil men of their goods and eſtates, and ſometimes of their lives, may pray to God too for proſperity in their pilfering courſes, (that is, in plain Engliſh, to bleſs them in their diſobedience to him with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for it) and count their prayer in ſuch caſe lawful too; and ſo <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and his deluded confederates, might <hi>moſt humbly beſeech God</hi> to bleſs them with ſuch ſucceſs againſt King <hi>David,</hi> that they might not onely uſurp his Authority, and caſt him out of his Throne, but that other of their neighbour Nations might be encouraged by their example to do the like to their own Kings; and ſo of any other whatſoever in the commiſſion of any villany: if they can but firſt have the courage to do the thing without fear of puniſhment, and in expectation of praiſe for it, and then can have but the confidence <hi>moſt humbly to beſeech God</hi> (as our Leaguers Cant it) <hi>to bleſs them with ſucceſs in it,</hi> if they ſay, <hi>yes,</hi> then I hope their Covenant ought to be aboliſhed and renounced, as being (what it is undoubtedly) ſinful in the matter of it.</p>

Again, the Leaguers declared (as <hi>Crofton</hi> himſelf told us lately, for I am ſcarce old enough to remember the doing of it) That they <hi>Aboliſhed the</hi> Common-prayer Book <hi>in purſuance of their Covenant.</hi> Very good; This very book (which they pretended to aboliſh with the power of an illegal ordinance) was not onely <hi>compiled by true Martyrs, and Reformers, and practiſed in the times of four Princes,</hi> but was (and is ſtill, <note place="margin">p. 62.</note> notwithſtanding their Rebellious Ordinance) <hi>ſetled by no leſs then</hi> five <hi>Acts of Parliament;</hi> And therefore their Covenant being in that act alſo contrary to the Lawes, <hi>All Miniſters and others that have</hi> taken this Oath, <hi>muſt teach themſelves and others,</hi> (according to the exhorters own aſſertion, for I love to take men at their words) that <hi>ſuch oaths call for repentance and not pertinacy in them,</hi> it being proved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65994:19"/> to be ſo far from being warranted by the Laws of the Land, that it is an abſolute breach of above 26 of them.</p>
            <p>§. 15. I remember, The Leaguers in their Diſputes and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">☞</note> againſt the wearing of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> and performance of other commendable Ceremonies of our <hi>beſt Reformed Church of England,</hi> do out of their wiſe Noddles ſend forth ſuch doughty windy Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as will excellently wel ſerve to prove the unlawfulneſs of their Covenant. Let a man go and ask them why they will not wear the <hi>Surplice,</hi> and live in conformity to the Rites and Cuſtoms of the Church, they'l tell him, becauſe they are unlawful: and why are they unlawful? becauſe God hath no where commanded them to be done in the Scripture; though in any wiſe mans judgement, there can be no unlawfulneſs in a thing, without it be a breach of ſome Law which hath forbid it, and where they will finde that Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Surplice</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> its poſſible they'l tell us when they are able, and their ability for that end will be I believe <hi>Ad Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas Calendas,</hi> but not well before. Now according to their own ways of arguing, I ſhall make this retortion; That God hath no where in the Scripture commanded ſubjects (in caſe of a default made by the Prince, or that he will not conſent to any Reformation) to riſe up in Arms, and rebel againſt him, and ſwear an Oath to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any Royal Conſent at all; and let any of the Pack make it appear if they can. For, for them to ſet down the examples of the Oaths and Covenants, Kings and Subjects joyntly made for a Reformation, when they are demanded to ſhow a pattern for their Covenant, is no more to the purpoſe, then to ſay, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Nobles made a Reformation in this kingdom, to pull us out of the miſt of Popiſh darkneſs; no more ſatisfaction to a Quaeriſt, then (as the Reverend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pierce</hi> told one of his Antagoniſts) for a man when he is asked what's a Clock, To anſwer a windmil, or a pump? for the queſtion is not, whether Kings and Subjects may joyntly ſwear a Reformation of Abuſes, either in Church or State, (for there is no body I think wil ſtand to diſpute that) but whether in caſe a King will not make that extirpating Reformation his Subjects would have him, whether they may do this without his conſent, by Oaths and riſing up in Armes, which is palpable rebellion? <note n="u" place="margin">See the League il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Where doth God command the Engliſh to ſwear to preſerve the Scotch Diſcipline and Liturgy, which they themſelves have often varied? Or to abjure Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, which was the onely Government of the Church for more then 1500 years, and under whoſe ſhade Chriſtian Religion moſt flouriſhed, and the Church ſtretched forth her branches to the Rivers, and her boughs to the ends
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65994:19"/> of the earth? Where doth the Scripture warrant (much leſs command) the aſſociation of two kingdoms, and joyntly taking up Arms in the Quarrel of the Goſpel, and defending and propagating Religion by the ſword?</hi> And let them anſwer that, or let their ſilence conclude their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: I ſay again, God never commanded Subjects any where in the Scripture, to make a Reformation without their Princes conſent by arms. And therefore to deal with them with their own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, according to their own ways of diſputations againſt the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, I affirm, that their Covenant is wicked and unlawful, and being an unlawful ſinful Oath, by the reſolution and judgement of all Caſuiſts, it ought not to be pleaded for, nor taken, or if once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to be kept by any that ever took it, becauſe <note n="x" place="margin">

               <hi>To obſerve a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked engagement, doubles the ſin,</hi> according to the found determinations of the Reverend Primate; And ſo my Argument herein, I am ſure, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> is unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>§. 16. The next thing that will come under examination, will be the unlawfulneſs of the Covenant, in reſpect of its contrariety to the two former legally eſtabliſhed Sacred Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtation;</hi> and to that end I commend to the conſideration of my Readers, the excellent Determination of the Iriſh Primate in relation to this point, in his incomparable <hi>Fair War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take heed of the Scottiſh Diſcipline,</hi> p. 31. Where (after he had affirmed <hi>That a Supervenient Oath or Covenant either with God or man, cannot take away the obligation of a juſt Oath precedent)</hi> he immediately addes, <hi>But ſuch is the Covenant, a ſubſequent Oath, inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive to a precedent Oath, that is, the Oath of</hi> Supremacy; <hi>which all the Church-men throughout the kingdom, and all Parliament men at their Admiſsion to the Houſe, and all perſons of quality thoughout</hi> England <hi>have taken. The former oath acknowledgeth the King to be the only Supream Head (that is, Civil Head, to ſee that every man do his duty in his calling) and Governor of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>The ſecond Oath or Covenant to ſet up the Presbyterian Government as it is in</hi> Scotland, <hi>denieth all this virtually, makes it a Political Papacy, acknowledgeth no Governors, but onely the Presbytery. The former Oath gives the King the Supream Power over all perſons, in all cauſes. The ſecond gives him a power over all, as they are Subjects, but none at all in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes. This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they make to be Sacriledge.</hi> And therefore I Quaere, 1. Whether he that hath taken the legally eſtabliſhed Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which (as a Paraphraſt very well noteth) <note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>See The Oathes of</hi> Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>&amp;</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>which have layen dead many years, &amp;c. p.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>Admits of no Rival in the Throne, but doth exclude all others from the Supremacy, from being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to act above His Majeſty, or contrary unto Him, or without Him, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65994:20"/> his allowance, in any acts of Government,</hi> can take this illegal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby he ſwears, according to his utmoſt power, not onely to carry on the Rebellion then already begun, (for that it was ſo, needs no further demonſtration) but alſo to aſſiſt all other perſons that ſhall take it, in what they ſhall do in purſuance thereof (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by implicitly owning the power of the then two Houſes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning the <hi>Onely</hi> Supremacy of the King, ſo clearly aſſerted in that Oath) I ſay, whether he that hath taken the former, can ever ſwear the latter, without a notorious guilt of apparent Perjury? If not, (as no man I think upon ſerious conſideration will affirm he may) then it neceſſarily follows that the one is an oppoſition to the other.</p>
            <p>Again, The Oath of Supremacy bindes the takers <hi>to their power, to aſsiſt and defend all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritys, granted, or belonging to the Kings Highneſs, and united and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm:</hi> And the famous Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> have told us, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">See their Reaſons, p. 38.</note> 
               <hi>the whole power of ordering all matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, was by the Laws of the Land in expreſs words,</hi> For ever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, (citing the Statute for it in their Margin:) whence I Quaere, Secondly, Whether he that hath once taken the Oath of Supremacy, and afterwards ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down this Regicidian League, was not deſperatly forſworn in taking upon them the ordering of Eccleſiaſtical matters (which is one of thoſe Juriſdictions and Priviledges granted to the Kings Highneſs) ſo far as to ſwear the Extirpation of the Legally eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Eccleſiaſtical Government, without, and againſt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Royal aſſent? one while ſwearing to defend the Juriſdiction and Preeminence granted, or belonging to the King, and another while <hi>vowing</hi> the performance of that which is abſolutely contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant unto it? And Perjury attained by taking of two Oaths, in my ſhallow judgement, doth unavoidably imply, the vaſt proportion of difference and contrariety that is between them. Since the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe laſt words, I heard of the burning of the Solemn League and Covenant, by the hands of the Common Hangman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Noble Order of the truely Honourable two Houſes, <note place="margin">May 22. 1661.</note> now at this preſent aſſembled in Parliament, by vertue of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Writ; which, as it is no more then its deſerts, in having bewitched people into an odious Rebellion againſt their Prince, which (as one ſaith well) <note n="z" place="margin">See the Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, p. 72.</note>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65994:20"/> from ſaying here any more of this Loyal Vote, concerning that monſtrous League, but ſhall now go on to the finiſhing of what I have here intended, to ſhow the ſinfulneſs thereof in its contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to former Legal Oaths; and to that end and purpoſe ſhall again Quaere: Thirdly, Can that Oath, <hi>Which</hi> * <hi>was deviſed onely to</hi>

               <hi>appear for the defence of him, of his Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, againſt all attempts againſt them, by any whatſoever, upon any pretences ſoever?</hi> Can any be ſo wilde and frantick, as to make ſuch an affirmation? Fifthly, How can that Oath which bindes men abſolutely to bear true faith and Allegiance to the King, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relation to his good, or bad Government, ſute with an Apoſtate that is ſworn with a curſed deſtructive limitation, to defend him ſo long as he ſhall continue in the preſervation of that, which the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower thereof ſhall fancifully call, <hi>the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom,</hi> and no longer? See more of this in the excellent <hi>Scotch-Covenant condemned;</hi> That the one is the intention of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and the other, the purpoſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, needs not to be demonſtrated with any illuſtration, ſeeing the doubters may be ſatisfied in the Oaths themſelves: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude the contrariety between the one and the other, in the words of the learned Paraphraſt, when he ſet down his minde with a <hi>Neither can that limitation in the Covenant, wherein they oblige</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Page 8.</note> 
               <hi>themſelves to the preſervation of the King, in the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Liberty of the ſubject, limit or abate the force of thoſe abſolute obligations, whereby all ſubjects are obliged to the King, and his lawful Heirs and Succeſſors, which are upon them by the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; but as ſuch limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65994:21"/> look very unhandſomly, ſo they have not at all any force of abatement in them, but ought to be abhorred, diſclaimed, and rejected by all honeſt Subjects and Chriſtians, as an evil gapp opened to Rebellion and Sedition to thoſe that have a minde to make ſuch an evil uſe thereof, under pretence that the King doth (that which indeed he ought not to do) either depart in any thing from the true Religion, or violate the Priviledges of Parliament, or the Liberties of the ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 17. Laſtly, For this League and Covenants contrariety to the Proteſtation, I ſhall firſt ſet down in general, the words of a Right Reverend perſon upon it, who hath told us, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">See the Ima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the Proteſtation was confined to eſtabliſhed Law, but the Covenant to deſtroy Law, and what was eſtabliſhed by it; the Protestation to defend the Doctrine, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to deſtroy the Government, which is comprehended in the Doctrine:</hi> How do theſe two hang together? Reconcile them, and it will be as eaſie to make light and darkneſs, order and confuſion, vertue and wickedneſs, lawful &amp; unlawful acts, to appear one &amp; the ſame thing to every perſons eye and ear; And therefore how ſhallow and weak ſoever my judgement is in every thing, yet I hope thoſe that are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, will excuſe me, though I preſume for once to commend, what I ſay now, to their, and every mans ſerious conſideration; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if I am erroneous, its not through wilfulneſs, or obſtinacy, but meerly for want of underſtanding to diſcern that which is better, (upon ſuppoſition that I am in an errour, which I cannot ſay, till I be convinced of it) and that which I have to ſay upon this account, ſhall come dreſſed to peoples eyes in no other terms then theſe which I have now ſubjoyned: Every one that took this Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did <hi>Vow and Proteſt to maintain and defend (as far as lawfully he might,</hi> obſerve that well, Sir <hi>John) with his life, power, and eſtate, the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England: Now minde, the Thirty nine Articles (as they are uſually called) have been alwaies hitherto wont to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Doctrine of the Church of England:</hi> the Thirty ſixth Article whereof is ſo far from ſpeaking againſt the Biſhops for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and promoting of a dogged, ſurly, Anti-Monarchical, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Diſcipline, that <hi>the very book of Conſecration of Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops, and ordering of Prieſts and Deacons,</hi> (which had the Royal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſanction at the making thereof) is affirmed there to <hi>have nothing in it that is ſuperſtitious or ungodly:</hi> and this is a part of that, which in this Proteſtation was termed, <hi>The true Proteſtant Religion:</hi> Nay, and this muſt not be defended neither, but <hi>as far as lawfully I may,</hi> ſo that if there had not been the leaſt mention of Epiſcopacy in any of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65994:21"/> the Articles, yet confining themſelves in their Proteſtation, to the rules and orders of the Laws, the Supremacy of the King over all perſons, Clergy and Lay, in all cauſes, Eccleſiaſtical, and Civil, and Epiſcopacy, its ſtout propp and defender, (both undermined, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and deſtroyed by a <hi>Scottiſh Diſcipline)</hi> ſtand as ſafe, and firm by the very Proteſtation, as they were before that was ever made or taken. Now comes a <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and bindes its takers, <hi>by force of Arms,</hi> to beat down Epiſcopacy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that very doctrine (which the Presbyters had ſworn <hi>to maintain and defend</hi> with their <hi>lives, powers, and eſtates)</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, <hi>to turn their neighbours</hi> (as the Revered Primate <note place="margin">

And therefore once again, I Quaere, Can that Proteſtation (whereby <hi>I A. B. do promiſe, vow, and protest to maintain and deſend, as far as lawfully I may, with my life, power, and eſtate, the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of England</hi> (wherein the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Biſhops is expreſly comprehended) any way agree with an illegal League, which bindes me to extirpate Biſhops (in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that Doctrine) as <hi>contrary unto the power of godlineſs</hi> Our Leaguers, I know, would fain be accounted true and good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and yet ſwear to extirpate that which is a main propp of the true Proteſtant Religion; and therefore in this caſe the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holds very firm and true, which was long ſince given of ſuch, at the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, That they are <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Proteſtants frayed out of their wits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, part of that doctrine which by the Proteſtation, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers vowed to defend is, that † <hi>The Kings Majeſty hath the chief power in his Realm of</hi> England <hi>and other his dominions, unto whom the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all ſtates of this Realm whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Civil in all cauſes doth appertain.</hi> And by the Covenant the takers ſwore to preſerve and maintain all the days of their lives the thing called the Scottiſh diſcipline; Now nothing can be more oppoſite to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the King aſſerted in the Article, and vowed to be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with life, power, and eſtate, in the Proteſtation, then this very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65994:22"/> Scottiſh diſcipline, which our <hi>Baal-Berithiſts</hi> by an after oath ſwore to preſerve: Yea light and darkneſs, God and the Devil, heaven and hell, the ſerving of Chriſt and the worſhipping of Baal, will aſſoon be brought to agree with each other, as the <hi>Scottiſh Presbytery</hi> will with <hi>Monarchy</hi> (King <hi>James</hi> told us it by a ſad doleful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) as the diſcipline of <hi>Scotland</hi> wil accord with the Regal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over all perſons, in all cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil; he that hath once read, and reading, well conſidered the Primates <hi>Fair Warning,</hi> to beware, and take heed of this <hi>Scottiſh Cockatrice,</hi> he will find cauſe enough to perceive a vaſt contradiction between the Proteſtation and this: Yea, and as different a ſound between them both, as there is betwixt two bells in a ſteeple, and ſo by good conſequence ſee too the horrible impiety of their ſolemn League and Covenant; The Proteſters vow too <hi>according to the duty of their Allegiance to maintain and defend His Majeſties Royal Perſon, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Eſtate,</hi> without any curſed deſtructive Limmittation of that defence; All which are diminiſhed decreaſed and taken away by Sir <hi>Johns</hi> Holy League, which therefore can admit of no accord between them; The late <hi>Carolian</hi> Martyr in his diſcourſe upon the covenant profeſſes he could not <note n="c" place="margin">

               <hi>See how they wil reconcile ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating</hi> (obſerve that, O Leaguer!) <hi>oath and Covenant with that former Proteſtation, which was ſo lately taken to maintain the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ſince they count diſcipline ſo great a part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> But if all that hath been ſaid, cannot (which in my weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſufficiently) prove the oppoſition of the one to the other, That there is a great deal of difference between them, may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiv'd by his Majeſties deep ſilence, when the Proteſtation was taken under his noſe, (as we uſe to ſay) when they were hard by him at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as well as by his Publick Printed proclamation as far as <hi>Oxford,</hi> againſt the taking of that <hi>Seditious and Traiterous Vow and Covenant</hi> (as he called it) in the day he heard thereof, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of all people upon their Allegiance, not to ſwear it, as inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the takers in Acts of high Treaſon; yea, and by the late order of the Lords and Commons for the Hangmans burning of it, when they did not ſo much as mention the Proteſtation, which if it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the Covenant, ſure enough thoſe Loyal Houſes would never have ſuffered it to have lain ſtill, but had ſent them both one way together; Upon conſideration of all that hath now bin ſaid by way of evidence, to prove the great contradiction between the two Legal Sacred Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and this jugling League and Covenant; for my own part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <hi>That this Covenant is neither valid, nor lawful, nor conſiſtent with our former oaths, but deceitful, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, impious, rebellious, and contradictory to our former ingagements, and conſequently obligeth no man to performance, but all men to repentance;</hi> And therefore the difference being ſo great between them, I appeal to any Caſuiſt living, whether the former muſt not be kept, as well as the latter rejected; the one ſtood to, and maintained for fear of its true conſequence, <hi>Perjury,</hi> as well as the other to be renounced, and diſclaimed for the very ſame cauſe by thoſe that took any of the three former; and ſo (according to the exhorting Leaguers own words) <hi>it calls for repentance and not pertinacy in it;</hi> which makes alſo palpable and manifeſt, the great neceſſity and juſtneſs, of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Vote of the two now moſt Honorable Houſes, when out of a noble diſdain to all Religious Rebellion, and Seditious Leaguing principles, as well as out of a true fear of God and the King, they ordered this <hi>Presbyterian Scotland whore</hi> to be burnt by the hands of <hi>Smectymnus</hi> the common hangman.</p>
            <p>§. 18. Having now gone through this peerleſs Covenant, and proved (as far as my poor underſtanding enables me to ſee,) the great ſinfulneſs thereof, both in the form and matter of it; and alſo its jugling contradictions in it ſelf, as well as its abſolute oppoſition to former Legal Oaths, (and ſo by conſequence, undeniable, the great neceſſity of every takers ſad and ſerious repentance, renuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abhorrence thereof.) I ſhall deſiſt from ſaying any more now of it, but ſhall from hence proceed to the conſideration and examination of a certain ſeditious Paper-book (entituled <hi>BERITH ANTI-BAAL)</hi> ſet forth by one <hi>ZECHARY CROFTON,</hi> (a Presbyter of the Right ſtamp) whoſe contradictions, and ſhallow Arguings therein againſt the reverend Lord Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> made it ſo much the fitter task for me to ſet down my Animadverſions on it; I know indeed the man is looked upon as the <hi>Diana</hi> of the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Brethren, and the ableſt to deal with ſuch unlearned Ceremonialiſts, as the ſhort-ſighted proſelites Judge the Profound Epiſcopalians (how learned ſoever they be.) But certainly they are either deceived in their Judgements of his parts, or elſe the man was ſo hampered with what the Biſhop replyed to him, that (as he affirmes of the Biſhop) in this Rejoynder of his <note n="e" place="margin">See the fifth ſide of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> 
               <hi>Having looſed from the Haven of Reaſon, true Religion, and the fear of God, he runs a drift wherever the wind of his own words can hurry him, and leades his Reader into a Wilderneſs, where he hears no ſound but the ſhrieks of Satyrs, bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and howling of beaſts, at beſt; raging and rayling of men, or wild and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65994:23"/> improper diſcourſes that tend to no certain end;</hi> For in my judgement, (which is none of the wiſeſt I am ſure, but nevertheleſs what I write, I commend to the cenſure of the impartially Judicious) this book of his (for a great part thereof) contains nothing but ſedition and juſtification of rebellion, to the debaſing of the Regal Supremacy, &amp; power of making Laws, or of giving his conſent thereunto (for <hi>Crof;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> tell us <hi>the two Houſes may exerciſe their Legiſlative power without the Royal conſent)</hi> and ſneaking away from the queſtion in hand, like a meer ſhifter, and acting in ſome places the part of a pitiful Caviller. And by that time I have ſet down what I have to ſay of it, I leave it to every Readers judgement to make anſwer whether it be not ſo in his; And to that end and purpoſe I ſhall ſet down what in my ſhort curſory peruſal of the Book, I found worth tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of to be anſwered; He (good man!) in a fit of piety cries out, <hi>The Lord deliver me from rendring railing for railng,</hi> And yet (to <note place="margin">Page 8.</note> give the world a ſpecimen of his breeding, and manners, and good words) in the ſecond ſide of his Preface, he ſaith, he <hi>fears nothing more then to be bound to his good behavior, for misbehaving himſelf ſo much as to anſwer a fool according to his folly,</hi> (meaning the learned Prelate) and to ſhow his meekneſs, humility and averſation to rayling (for he tells us p. 8. <hi>he doth not delight to rake in that puddle,)</hi> In the very firſt ſide of his Preface, he compares the Biſhop <hi>to the Devil,</hi> in the fifth and ſixth, <hi>to the Heretiques,</hi> and <hi>Harding the Jeſuit,</hi>

               <hi>Sir, Who told you that this was the politick ſtratagem of that pious Biſhop? Did not Biſhop</hi> Wren? It would make a man mad, and t'would make a man laugh, to ſee ſuch pitiful arguings uſed in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder to an Antagoniſt, and yet to be believed as excellent, and invincible by ſome people, to hugge themſelves up in their deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Juſt as if a man ſhould make ſuch a like Quaere to him, Who <hi>told people that it was little Mr.</hi> Croftons <hi>Politick ſtratagem, not onely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65994:23"/> to whipp his maid behinde, but before too?</hi> Did not the Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and ſeveral other of the Pariſhioners of that Pariſh, where that noble Miniſterial act was done, to adminiſter ſomewhat to the maids neceſſities? So again, The Biſhop having ſaid, <hi>That the League which</hi> Joſhua, <hi>and the Rulers of the people made with the Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panning</hi> Gibeonites, <hi>was to the damage of no honeſt men, but themſelves: Crofton</hi> cries out, <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
               <hi>Was the Oath of the</hi> Gibeonites <hi>no way to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of honeſt men? Was it no injury to</hi> Iſrael <hi>to looſe four Cities out of their inheritance given them by the Lord?</hi> Whereas the Biſhop had ſaid, <hi>It was to the injury of no honeſt men, but themſelves,</hi> which two laſt words, <hi>Crofton</hi> very cunningly leaves out, to make his Readers believe the convincing force of his Arguments: But alas! he knew to ſet down the whole Propoſition, was not for his turn of diſputing, but would have broke the neck of his cauſe and deſign, and made it evident to every one, that he was a meer ſhifting caviller; one that was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more to quarrel with an Antagoniſt, then to anſwer him by good Reaſons and Arguments; which practiſe of his brings to my remembrance, the like cavilling tricks and ſhiftings, of the moſt learned Biſhop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Puritanical Informers in the very ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame caſe; who thereupon told them, that the ſetting down of his whole paſſage and Propoſition <note n="f" place="margin">

            <p>§. 20. So again, The Biſhop having ſaid, <q>That <note n="g" place="margin">

               <hi>Crofton</hi> thinks fit to give no other anſwer but this <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Which all people of the world muſt, and will contradict;</hi> and leaving out (like a wrangling Sophiſter) the principal Clauſe, and Hinge of the Biſhops Sentence, on which hangs the force of the preceding words, which is this: <hi>And neceſſary for his high calling, to protect the Church and State, himſelf, and his good Subjects.</hi> And doth he, or any one in his wits, think that any Prince may Vow to diminiſh that, whereby his Subjects are defended? to extenuate and give away that Power he hath given him by God, to Preſerve and Protect thoſe people, over whom, by the ſame God, he is ſet as Ruler and Supream? To caſt his Subjects, in a maner, out of his Protection, and give leave to others to Domineer, and Tyrannize over them, and do them what rapine and miſchief they will, and he himſelf ſit ſtill, as a Cipher? Certainly thoſe people that are in ſuch a caſe, may well cry out of an <hi>Egyptian ſlavery,</hi> and ſadly proclaim,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65994:24"/> to their great grief and ſorrow both of heart and minde, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man doth that which ſeems right in his own eyes, as though there were no King at all in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> That a Prince may vow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his own juſt Sovereginty and power (which is too hard for his Subjects to bear, and when ſuch diminution tends to their eaſe and benefit) no body indeed in the world I think will deny; but that is nothing at all to what the Biſhop ſaith: But that a Prince may not Covenant the diminution of his own juſt Soveraignty and Power <hi>neceſſary for his high calling,</hi> to protect his Subjects (which, and which alone is what the Biſhop ſays) is a truth as cleer as the Sun, and in that caſe our Presbyters, <hi>all people in the world that muſt and will contradict it,</hi> muſt beyond diſpute be ſuch people as belong to the world in the Moon.</p>
            <p>§. 21. Again, the Biſhop having ſet down p. 149. <q>That the two Houſes alone, no nor the King alone, or with them, have any Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative power to decree or execute what is unrighteous againſt God or man:</q> The Shifter anſwers with a <note n="*" place="margin">p. 32.</note> 
               <hi>So that the Legiſlation is founded in the piety and juſtice of the decree, and rebellion againſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is acquitted by the iniquity of the command;</hi> not at all caring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that what the Biſhop ſaith in thoſe words, muſt needs have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Law of God; and his meaning thus, that by that Law neither King nor two Houſes, joyntly or ſeverally have any lawful power to decree or execute what is unrighteous: for its impoſſible that that Reverend Prelate ſhould ever forget what he hath read in the Scriptures of wickedneſs eſtabliſhed by a Law, and the poſſibility of Governors Legiſlative power to execute <note n="†" place="margin">Iſa. 10. 1</note> 
               <hi>unrighteous decrees</hi> by the <hi>Woe,</hi> that by God himſelf is pronounced <hi>unto them that decree</hi> ſuch: Nay, the very language of the Biſhop in that aſſertion of his, doth convince me cleerly that he was wholly guided by this very Scripture in what he ſaid (which <hi>Crofton</hi> ſo much carps at) and ſo (as I juſt now ſaid) muſt needs have reference to the lawfulneſs of ſuch power for ſuch ends, and purpoſes by the Law of God which expreſly hath prohibited it, and pronounced a woe againſt the Actors of it. But hark what the man makes a matter of complaint of! why, that <hi>Rebellion</hi> by the Biſhops ſaying (oh how loyal he is all of a ſudden, and fearful of maintaining any Rebellious principles, not above eight lines before he hath point blanck affirmed (nay, and as though it were a convincing truth too) what I ſhall prove before I have done with him, not onely to be ſedition and rebellion, but an open denial of the Supremacy, Power, and Authority of His Moſt Sacred Majeſty: but lets hear what he can ſay for himſelf, why ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65994:24"/> of condemnation ſhould not be paſſed againſt him for a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; he ſaith, that by the Biſhops aſſertion it follows, that <hi>Rebellion) againſt authority is acquitted by the iniquity of the command;</hi> Pray <hi>Mr.</hi> Caviller tell me, whether an impious decree muſt be done or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Command of any Prince whatſoever, by any one that hath the fear of the King of Kings before his eyes? Is not rebellion in that caſe againſt man, loyalty and true Allegiance towards God, and ſo by Sacred Rules Juſtifiable and acquitted? What think you of that Antichriſtian <note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 5: 27, 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrait command</hi> and decree, that the Jewiſh high Prieſt and Councel once gave unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>not to teach in the name of Jeſus?</hi> And of their ſtout noble Chriſtian anſwer, <hi>we ought to obey God rather then men?</hi> Was not their Rebellion (if it muſt needs be ſo called) here againſt the Jewiſh Governors juſtifiable, and acquitted by their loyalty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in performing of that which he had commanded them to do, &amp; miraculouſly inſpired them with his holy ſpirit for that end? Certainly the man is either out of his wits in this complaint, or elſe an evident Rebel againſt his Savior, as his party (if not his own ſelf) have bin formerly againſt their Prince; for where the Laws of God and man, run counter, and come in competition one with another, I conceive its no Rebellion at all to obſerve the former in what he commands, &amp; not at all the latter, and he that ſhall make it a matter of complaint of a mans Chriſtian refuſing in ſuch a caſe and terming it by the odious name of Rebellion, he muſt certainly be an Atheiſt, one that regards not the injunctions of the <note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 15.</note> 
               <hi>bleſſed &amp; onely Potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords;</hi> I remember an obſervable ſaying of one of His Majeſties <hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects to this purpoſe, though he tels us that <note n="h" place="margin">See the right Rebel p. 28.</note> 
               <hi>It appeares, that that which ſometimes is eſteemed and termed Rebellion by men may be, and is in truth, and in Gods accompt, not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but neceſſary alſo, and ſo not rebellion indeed, but duty; As when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the commands of inferiors in authority, are diſobeyed in obedience unto the lawful commands of thoſe that in authority are their Superiors; So the Sovereignty of God, being abſolutely Supream, as himſelf is the moſt high over all, if men (though the higheſt upon earth) command that which is forbidden by God, or forbid that which is commanded by him, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but neceſſary Rebellion (if it may be ſo called) to obey him, though they thereby be diſobeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 22. Again, The Biſhop having ſaid, <hi>page</hi> 146. That the King <q>may not Covenant to diminiſh or deſtroy any honeſt ſubjects, in any of their juſt Rights, much leſs to extirpate or expel out of his Dominions, any Rank, Order, and Degree of men that are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65994:25"/> and in ſome ſenſe neceſſary for the being, and well being of his people: Nay, neither Prince, or any party of the People may Vow to extirpate the meaneſt Calling, which ſerves the body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licick, any more then men may Vow to cut off their feet or toes,</q> (for I love to ſet down the words as I find them in the clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and not as they run in the unclean, muddy Streams of the Wranglers giddy brains.) The Shifter contents himſelf with one of his merry whimſies, to laugh out his Reverend Antagoniſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to give out a ſolid anſwer to the Biſhops Aſſertion, and ſaies, (behold, Reader, the profound quality of his Argument!) <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Tinkers, and Pedlers, and men of the like Order, will certainly cleave cloſe to this Conſervator of their Liberty;</hi> where the man wants ability to anſwer, there he he affords his Readers one of the marks of his Crazy Brain, as conceiving that his Proſelites, <note n="†" place="margin">See his Preface.</note> 
               <hi>doting on the bare ſay-ſo of an holy Leaguer,</hi> will the ſooner perſwade them to believe the ſtrength of his cavilling Objections; when he wants wherewith to convince an Opponent, he thinks its enough if he can but give him a Jeer, and afford him matter of laughter; which in a wiſe mans judgement, redounds to the diſcredit and ſhame of none, but the pittiful gaſping Aſſerter, who being deſtitute of ſound Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the ſupporting of his Sandy Building, and the holding up of his tottering Cauſe, thinks it ſufficient if he can but get ſo much breath as may enable him to ſling a Jeer at his Antagoniſt, before he, and his Covenant, do joyntly breath their laſt. He reſolved, it ſeems, to ſay ſomthing, rather then be thought to want wherewith to gainſay; and therefore laid down the preceding Poſition, to ſooth up his Proſelites with a belief of his Abilities, when (if they are no better then that I have hitherto taken notice of) they may well be compared to thoſe of fools, the upſhot of whoſe wiſedom is to be <hi>wiſe in their own conceits:</hi> and were he any more then <note n="*" place="margin">See p. 8. of his book.</note>

               </q> leaving out thoſe words of the Doctors, which made his learned Aſſertion unanſwerable, and true beyond any ſound contradiction, which are theſe, <hi>(To any,</hi> that is, <hi>AS</hi> new <q>and Schiſmatical, <hi>SO</hi> far worſe and unſutable to <hi>England</hi> every way) that ſo his own arguings might thereby appear the better,</q> and ſound more pleaſingly to the ears of his factious brethren (a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe ſomewhat like unto one that pictures a man with the greateſt deformity of body he can, for no other end, but to make his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deformed one, appear the neater and beautifuller.) But I conſider, otherwiſe he could not hide his folly from being palpable and open to every perſon (that is not poſſeſſed of a Bedlamers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) nor his Book from being thrown into the fire by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous perſons, rather then they would vex themſelves ſo much as

But we will ſee, however, what the man conceived fit in his <hi>Scotized</hi> noddle, to ſay for himſelf, and make it the matter of his Anſwer to the words of the Biſhop, as he had filthily mangled them in his falſe quotation of them; and that I finde, upon ſearch, to be this learned one that follows, with a <note n="m" place="margin">P. 25. <hi>of his Book.</hi>

            <p>§. 25.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65994:28"/> and controuling the ſubordinate governors, and their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as well as the peoples in the ſeveral Churches they planted, and enjoyning the ſame to be done by his Epiſcopal deputies at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> (and in them all their ſucceſſors in the Epiſcopal office) in thoſe ſeveral Churches over whom they had their juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Certainly he that tells me, that <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1.</note>

            <p>§. 26. That they <hi>have no lawful authority to change it,</hi> which muſt needs have reference to the Laws of God according to the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words of the Biſhops, where he explaines his meaning by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly aſſerting, <hi>That Chriſtian Kings and their Parliaments are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Laws of God, and rules oſ Chriſtian piety and polity too, of which the whole Church in its primitive example is the beſt interpreter,</hi> and ſo his poſition in ſhort is this, That they <hi>have no lawful authority by the Laws of God, and rules of Chriſtian piety, and polity to change Epiſcopal Government,</hi> which is a cleer evident truth to me, for I conſider with my ſelf, that thoſe <hi>Laws and Rules</hi> will admit at no hand of any ſchiſm, ataxy, confuſion, or diviſion in the Church, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true Chriſtianity (for the abounding whereof amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they were ſo often taxed of their too much <hi>carnality)</hi> and that Biſhops were ſet up by the Apoſtles themſelves <hi>in remedium Schiſmatis,</hi> for the preventing of ſchiſmes and diviſions, and that none of thoſe <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>hereſies</hi> were ſo prevalent or apparent to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eyes in the Biſhops times, as ſince their <hi>Julian</hi> extirpation for the ſetting up of <hi>Prsbyterian practical-jeſuitiſm,</hi> was the ground of a day of faſting, and humiliation amongſt the <hi>Godly rebels,</hi> and a Sermon thereupon preached by our <hi>unſacred Covenanter;</hi> What ſhall we ſay to thoſe things, that men ſhould ſhow ſo much pretence of goodneſs in appointing a day to humble themſelves for the errors and hereſies of the times (the true proper effects, of their arrogant ways of Rebellion, in ſetting up Presbytery as a diſtinct Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by it ſelf, without Epiſcopacy, in direct oppoſition to the practiſe of the Catholick Church, as well as to the King and his Laws, which is, and hath bin the head and fountain from whence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65994:28"/> the unclean muddy ſtreames of hereſies and blaſphemies have had their riſe and product) And yet forſooth, muſt have the means ſtill kept for the production of the ſame ends of diſorder and confuſion, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon</hi> the conſideration of the whole, I cannot but ſubſcribe to the great truth of the Biſhops words, <q>That as no legiſlative power is impowered by Gods Laws to bring in either Hereſie, Error, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Schiſme, Faction, or Confuſion, ſo neither have the King, Lords and Commons any prudent, moral, religious, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority by thoſe Laws or thoſe of this Engliſh Nation, and Rules of Chriſtian Piety and Polity, to change the Ancient, univerſal, and excellent Government by Biſhops to any that is, As new and ſchiſmatical, ſo far worſe and unſuitable to <hi>England</hi> every way.</q> If one part of the ſentence be true (which by <hi>Croftons</hi> ſilence is abſolutely concluded.) No man need fear to affirm the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any derogation to the legal, rightful, Supremacy of the King; That which ſpeakes againſt Schiſme and faction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder, will not ſurely give me any lawful power to extirpate Biſhops, the main preventers of it, by being the conſtant promoters of love and unity.</p>
            <p>§. 27. Thus I have examined the words as I found them imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quoted in <hi>Croftons</hi> Diſcourſe, without that additional clauſe which I have ſet down in my true Citation of them, which he moſt unworthily and baſely had left out, that ſo he might have ſome what to fill up his rambling diſcourſe with; for a true Citation would have fo confounded his underſtanding, as immediately to have commanded him into a becoming ſilence and ingenuous conviction of the Biſhops truths: but rather then he would depart from his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing art and ſhiftings, he'l mangle the words of an Antagoniſt to make his own way the ſmoother, for credulous poor mortals to ſet their ſteps in; which hath brought to my remembrance the anſwer of a moſt Reverend perſon to the <hi>Miltonian</hi> Juſtifier of Regicide and Rebellion, depraver of verity and breaker of the Kings Image, That he <note n="p" place="margin">See the Image un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, p. 153.</note> 
               <hi>broke ſentences and truths, leſt he ſhould breake for want of matter;</hi> And the words of the Biſhops with that additional clauſe in it, is ſo cleer a truth as can no waies be darkned by a Presbyters Argumentations (which was ſeen evident enough by <hi>Crofton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo very craftily left it out) and therefore needs no other defence but the bare words themſelves which carry truth in their forehead, to the convincing of any oppoſer, which I have no ſooner done but I took a reſolution to follow the mans pattern for once, and turn Quaeriſt too,</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65994:29"/>
            <p>Where's the <hi>Premunire</hi> that the Biſhop hath ſtept into now? Is ſpeaking of a known Truth, confronting of King and Parliaments? Suppoſe the Biſhop had lived in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, and had ſaid, That neither Queen nor Parliament had any lawful power by the Laws of God, and Rules of Chriſtian Piety and Polity, either to change the King <hi>Edward</hi>-Reformation, or to ſet up and eſtabliſh Popery in the kingdom, Was it fit for any mans mouth but a curſed Jeſuits, to charge him with ſedition and treaſon againſt the Queen, in confronting her and her Parliaments, by ſaying black is black, and white is white, by aſſerting a known truth? Bleſſed be God, we live under a Prince that deſires not to have His Supremacy ſtretcht ſo, as to make it an Inſtrument of Juſtification of the Lawfulneſs of His Actings, either againſt God, or his Truth, or the Defenders of true Chriſtianity; that deſires to have His Supremacy carryed on, and maintain'd for no other ends and purpoſes, then thoſe for which it was firſt eſtabliſhed, To make Clergy-men as well as Lay, know that he is their onely Supream Governor, and in caſe of offence, that His Power will reach to the puniſhment of both; that they ſhall not be exempted from the Civil Magiſtrates ſword of Juſtice, either by the wicked pretence of a foreign, Papal, ſuperior Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or Antimonarchical Sentence or Determination of the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ſeditious Conſiſtorians, if they do that which is not juſtifiable either by the Laws of God, or this Land? Where's the Biſhops ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I wonder? Where's his treaſon, that he needs to fear to be made leſs by the head for (as this Leaguer cants it)? Why he ſaith, <hi>in affirming the defect of the Kings and Parliaments prudent, moral, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and lawful power to change Epiſcopacy to one that is worſe, and far unſuitable to</hi> England <hi>every way</hi> (for that is it which the Biſhop ſaith, which our unſacred Covenanter hath dared to contradict with his ſhabbed pratling). Ay but, ſaith <hi>Crofton, The Statutes of the Kings declare againſt the Pope, That Holy Church was founded in Prelacy by their own donation, power and authority, and ſo by the ſame way changeable: Ergo,</hi> What? That they have any prudent, moral, religious, and lawful authority to change it to a worſe? After what rate doth this wily Covenanter argue? Can they that ſwear to govern a people well, and according to the Laws of the Land, have any of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary Power, to change one Government for a worſe? Will the people in ſuch a caſe think (or can they?) that they are well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or that their Prince mind their peace and ſafety? If I may be ſo bold with the world as to tell them my ſimple judgement of thoſe words of the Kings, I humbly conceive (with ſubmiſſion to thoſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65994:29"/> that are wiſer) That thoſe Statutes were made meerly to cut off the ſpring of the Popes univerſal Supremacy, and as much (as in them lay) to caſt out his bold, unwarrantable, antichriſtian En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Engliſh Liberties, and to give acheck to his Lordly domineering over them, that the Kings (as now) might have their due rightful Supremacy over all perſons in all cauſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their dominuous, Over Clergymen (who were humble ſervants, to the principles and injunctions of the <hi>Papal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper)</hi> as well as over Common people (who were led by the noſe by them,) <hi>In all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> to reform Abuſes in the Church, and puniſh Clergy-men for their Errors, Hereſies, and Seditious principles, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel <hi>as Civil,</hi> To execute <hi>wrath upon thoſe that do evil,</hi> either by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or Treaſon, or Speaking, or bellowing out from Preſs, or Pulpit their damnable poſitions againſt their Perſons Crowns Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or Governments upon any accompt with any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons joynt or ſeperate whatſoever; This I underſtand to be the grounds of that Royal ſaying, <hi>That holy Church was founded in prelacy by their own donation power and authority,</hi> and not for any intentions of theirs to extirpate Epiſcopal Government, or the manifeſtation of the lawfulneſs of their <hi>power by the Laws of God, and Rules of Chriſtian Piety and Polity</hi> for the doing of it.</p>
            <p>§. 28. But the man hath not done yet, but hath ſome more queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions (ſuch as they are) to be anſwered ſtill, and therefore Ile ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the conſideration of them, and what ſhould they be but theſe paultry impertinent ones that follow (which are as proper Queries for the Biſhops true poſition, as if he ſhould have put his pen in's tail, and held them both up to the Sun to look at,) <hi>Where is</hi> (Sir) <hi>the Kings Prerogative over all perſons in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical? What is become of your Oath of Supremacy?

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65994:30"/> in ſum, the three amount but to one: and firſt he asks, <hi>Where is, Sir, the Kings Prerogative over all perſons, in all Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical?</hi> Good lack! what a great Upholder of the Regal Supremacy you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, Mr. Caviller?

Certainly then there needs no great fear of danger from the <hi>Apoſtatical Calvinian Hierarchy,</hi> or of <hi>Letters of horning</hi> from the <hi>Scotized Presbytery;</hi> But good now, Sir Presbyter, Why <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative?</hi> Why not <hi>Supremacy?</hi> Was that word like a Biſhops Lawn Sleeves to your party, that it would have choaked you to have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it? In all my little reading did I never meet with that word <hi>Prerogative</hi> joyned with that ſentence before, put in in ſtead of the rightful word <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which makes me think of a tacit denial of the thing, at that very time he ſaucily corrects the Biſhop for his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming contradictory Poſition to it, as giving a back-blow to the Kings Supremacy in his ſeeming paultry defence of it, elſe ſurely he would have made uſe of the uſual word <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and not impotently ask <hi>Where is the Kings Prerogative over all perſons in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical?</hi> Come, come, Mr. <hi>Zechary,</hi> you are a cunning companion, and lie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the catch, to ſee how you can take away a Prelates credit from him, but all wont do, you are horribly deceived if you think to meet with any unbyaſſed perſons, to trap them into your cheating Snare with you; for there's none that compares one Book with the other (as I have done) but will ſee your cunning Sophiſtry, and infamous ways of arguing, and thereby learn to deteſt the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing Author of the one, and honor the reverend Writer of the other. If he that ſaith, <hi>That the King hath no prudent, moral, religious and lawful Authority by the Laws of God, and Rules of Chriſtian Piety and Polity, to change Epiſcopal Government unto any one elſe that is AS new, and ſchiſmatical, SO far worſe and unſuitable to</hi> England <hi>every way,</hi> (and ſo not to bring in Schiſm or Hereſie) denies the Supremacy of the King, certainly the great and invincible maintainers of it againſt the joynt encroachments of Papiſt and his brother Presbyter, will be quickly found to be againſt it (and ſo indeed every one elſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Chriſtianity, ſenſe, or reaſon); Take the Supremacy in that notion for which it was firſt eſtabliſhed, and this Aſſertion of the Prelates may very well conſiſt with the Oath; but if this <hi>Calvinian</hi> prater for a little cavilling ſport, (for its for no other end be be ſure, for he is either no Presbyter, or if he be, he is no more a friend to, or pleader for the Kings lawful Supremacy, according to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65994:30"/> the true intent and meaning of the Framers of the Oath, then the rigideſt Jeſuit at <hi>Rome)</hi> will take it to reach to every thing, that he that denies the Kings lawful power to do that which is unrighteous by the Laws of God, is preſently againſt His legal Supremacy, Then not onely the reverend Prelates and Epiſcopal Divines (the onely conſtant Aſſertors of it all along, againſt the ſeveral wilde fancies of Jeſuits and <hi>Scotized</hi> Presbyters) but the Kings Sacred Majeſty himſelf wil be found to be vehement oppoſers of it. I'm confident His Highneſs deſires no ſuch thing, but that His Supremacy might onely reach ſo far, as he may lawfully exerciſe it without breach of the Laws of God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>§. 31. But he'l Print Errors, and give a Reaſon for it when he hath done. <hi>I do averr</hi> (ſaith he, like an arch Presbyter) <hi>That the Engliſh laws finding Epiſcopacy converſant about the Church, doth reſtrain its exorbitances, and direct its adminiſtrations; but neither Canon, nor Common Law doth eſtabliſh it, and</hi> in terminis, <hi>declare and authorize it to be the Government of the Church of</hi> England; That neither Canon, nor Common Law doth eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy, is notoriouſly falſe, by your good leave, Mr. Shifter: And that neither do, <hi>in terminis,</hi> declare it to be the <hi>Government of the Church of</hi> England, is clearly beſide the purpoſe. Tis not your <hi>(I averr)</hi> nor mine neither, will

            <p>I had not read much further beyond theſe laſt words, but I meet with a Trayterous expreſſion of his, in his venemous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Reverend Biſhop, which makes as clear as the Sun, what a Factious, Seditious ſpirit a <hi>Sacred Covenanter</hi> is compoſed of; even ſuch, That if the Law makes once a ſtrict enquiry, will ſend his head to accompany his Brethren in Iniquity upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge; and to that end, obſerve the words of this factious Pulpiteer.</p>
            <p>§. 32. The Biſhop having ſaid, <q>That the Parliament (he means the the two Houſes) can Act, Vote, Determine, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute nothing under the Kings withdrawing from them into any part of his own Countrey,</q>

Perfectly opinionated of the Sovereign power of the two Houſes over the King, and ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a Second Rebellion upon the old falſe thredbare grounds <hi>of Loyalty and Religion!</hi> He offers firſt, as an argument againſt the Legiſlative power of his Sovereign, for that feigned ſuppoſitious one of the two Houſes, <hi>That they may do all things in his infancy, or whileſt in a Forreign Countrey.</hi> Either the man is very ſhort ſighted, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply verſed in the Royal Engliſh Laws (and yet before we finde him pretending to it) or elſe he is a wilful <hi>Sophiſticator:</hi> If he is not

If he doth know the Laws, he is the blindeſt of all Beetles, by being wilfully blinde, and ſpeaking contrary to his knowledge (I do not mean contrary to his deſire, or his Trayterous Seditious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) for its a thing too well known and evident to be denied by any (whoſe face is not perfect mettal, and free from all the ſparks of Modeſty) That in <hi>the infancy of a King,</hi> there is a Protector ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Princes Supream Legiſlative place of Calling, Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and Diſſolving of Parliaments; of ſetting the Stamp of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sanction upon the Writings and requeſts of the Two Houſes for the making of them Laws (for without the Royal conſent, no Law) and Repealing of old Laws, if it be thought convenient; and this that I ſay, is confirmed by that learned and Reverend Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Lex ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, <hi>p.</hi> 52.</note> 
               <hi>the Protector, aſsiſted by the Counſel of the King at Law, his twelve Judges, the Counſel of State, his Attorney, Sollicitor, and two Serjeants at Law, his twelve Maſters of the Chancery, hath in the Kings behalf, and ever had a Negative voice.</hi> And whileſt the Prince is in a Forreign Countrey, there are certain Noble men Commiſſioned under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to ſupply his place, while he comes himſelf, as the Hiſtories of our Kings (whileſt in Forreign parts) do atteſt, as well as the practiſes of our preſent Prince (whom God long preſerve out of the juggling, murdering Clutches <hi>of Presbyterian Judaſſes)</hi> in relation to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by appointing a <hi>Lord Commiſsioner</hi> in the one, and a <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> in the other, to ſupply the place of Majeſty in both Kingdoms; So that his <hi>(may yet do all things in his infancy, or whilest in a Forreign Countrey)</hi> without either <hi>Protector</hi> at the one time, or <hi>Deputed Nobles</hi> at the other, is nothing elſe but a meer fiction, a deluſive Cheat, (the effects of his Crazy brain) endeavoured to be put into peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples belief, and therefore I'le trouble my ſelf no further with it.</p>
            <p>§. 33. But behold, the ſpirit of the man! <hi>That neither the place of his Majeſties Retirement, nor reaſon of his Abſence, doth add or abſtract to the Authority of Parliament,</hi> Is the iſſue and fruits of his wilde ſeditious humor. He (without whom there can be neither Parliament nor Law) is concluded by this hair-braind Presbyter, to be but as a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and that the two Houſes are a compleat Parliament of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, without his Sacred Majeſty, their <hi>Only</hi> Supream head and Founder. By what Warrant were they at firſt called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Was it not by vertue of his Majeſties Writ? And was not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65994:33"/> the tenor of that Writ, <hi>the Treating, and Adviſing with the King?</hi> And did they perform the ends, for which they were ſummoned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when they raiſed Tumults againſt their Prince, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him away from them, and at laſt had the confidence to declare <hi>by their Votes of non-Addreſſes,</hi> that <hi>they would neither Treat, nor Adviſe with him?</hi> If not, then tis clear they ſate to no purpoſe in the world, but ingraved the name of <hi>Rebels</hi> upon their foreheads, and made themſelves to be no Parliament, by deſtroying the ends for which they were called together. But becauſe <hi>Crofton</hi> is ſo arrogant in denying the Kings <hi>Preſence or Abſence</hi> to be of any force or validity in <hi>adding or diminiſhing the Authority of a Parliament,</hi> I ſhall make bold to preſent him with this one Example, <q>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned <note place="margin">3.

               </q> What think you now, Sir <hi>Presbyter?</hi> You ſee the Queens <hi>preſence,</hi> and <hi>the reaſon of her abſence</hi> was ſo far looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſteemed in thoſe daies, in relation to <hi>the Authority of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> that her <hi>abſence</hi> but for two daies, by the reſolution of all the Engliſh Judges, was enough to degrade them of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary title, till her Perſonal appearance amongſt them gave them the denomination of a Parliament: And unleſs this man can make it out, That the late bleſſed <hi>Carolian</hi> Martyr, had not the ſame place and Authority over theſe Nations, as that noble <hi>Queen</hi> had, the ſame Concluſion will follow upon his Aſſertion, <hi>That the place of his Royal retirement, and reaſon of his abſence,</hi> did ſo far <hi>add and abſtract to the Authority of</hi> that, which our Presbyterian Jugglers ſo often miſcal, <hi>a Parliament,</hi> that they were neither Titular, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, neither Name, nor Thing without him, <hi>For</hi>

            <p>The Parliament? What is that? It is the King, the Lords, and the Commons, ſaith the Covenant at the trial of the <hi>Regicide Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. That the world may not be abuſed by the inſinuations of a man, who

               <hi>them? The whole body, and volumes of the Statutes proclaim the King, the ſole Legiſlator. What is</hi> Magna Charta <hi>but the Kings Will and gift; The very beginning of it will tell you tis no more,</hi> viz. Henry <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Know yee that we of our meer, and free will have given theſe Liberties; In the ſelf ſame ſtile runs</hi> Charta de forreſta. <hi>But wherefore evidences to prove that which no man can deny? The ſtiles of the Statutes and Acts printed to the</hi> 1 <hi>of</hi> Henry <hi>VII. are either, the King willeth, the King ordaineth, the King provideth, the King grants, the King ordains at his Parliament, or the King ordaineth by the advice of his Prelates, and Barons, and at the humble petition of the Commons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But in</hi> Henry VII. <hi>his time, the ſtile altered, and hath ſithence continued thus; It is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Kings Majeſty, and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled. And why do the Lords and Commons ordain? Is it not onely becauſe the King doth? It is ſo; they do, becauſe the King doth, which onely denotateth their aſſent, for the Kings Majeſty giveth life to all, as the Soul to the body; For did ever the Lords and Commons make an Act without the King? Never; They cannot; The Lords adviſe, the Commons conſent, but the King makes the Law; Their Bills are but Inanimate ſcriblings, until the King breaths into their Noſtrils the breath of life, and ſo that which was mould before, becometh a Law, which ruleth living ſouls. And as Sir</hi> Edward Cook <hi>obſerveth, In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times all Acts of Parliaments were in form of petitions, which the King anſwered at his pleaſure; Now if it be the duty of the Parliament to petition, and in the power of the King to receive or reject their petitions at their will, Judge you who hath the ſupream power. Thus far he.</hi>

            <p>§. 35. By what hath been ſaid, I leave it to any underſtanding perſon to judge, where <hi>the Legiſlative power</hi> lies, whether in the <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> who <hi>moſt humbly beſeech His Majeſty</hi> (under the notion of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and loyal Subjects) for making new Laws, Or in the King, who <hi>grants their petitions, makes the Law, and ordains it to be obſerved,</hi> who both by the Law and a Sacred Oath, is declared and ſworn to be the <hi>onely Supream</hi> Governor of the Land.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65994:35"/>
            <p>That there is no difference between <hi>a Son and Servant,</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Maſter, and the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> to <hi>the King,</hi> is clear by one oath they took, wherein they ſwear <hi>To bear true faith and allegiance to our Sovereign Lord the King,</hi> and by the other they acknowledge (cutting off all pretences of <hi>Co-ordination)</hi> His Majeſty <hi>to be the onely Supream</hi> Governor of the Land; which implies His Lordſhip and Dominion over them; And they in all their Addreſſes and Declarations, ſtile themſelves <hi>His dutiful and loyal ſubjects,</hi> (and ſo <hi>ſervants)</hi> and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Kings ſtile of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> may be very well called <hi>ſons</hi> too. And ſeeing the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> imaginary <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> by the Laws of this Land, is not able to impower and authorize them, either to make new Laws, or to repeal old ones, without the Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Majeſty, it clearly follows, That their vowing to extirpate Biſhops, eſtabliſhed by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (confirmed by 32 Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and irrepealable) was not <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> it lay not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor had no right to do it without His Majeſties conſent, and ſo having not that, according to <hi>Croftons</hi> own grant, the Action vowed was <hi>ſuperſeded,</hi> (and might very well be ſo) by His Majeſties publick Proclamation, <hi>(his declared pleaſure)</hi> againſt the <hi>taking</hi> or <hi>impoſing</hi> of it, in regard it was a <hi>traiterous and ſeditious Vow and Covenant,</hi> and therefore null and void to all intents and purpoſes. But further, our Leaguer affirms, That</p>
            <p>§. 36. <hi>Their power in this Covenant was no leſs Legiſlative, then in the Proteſtation of May,</hi> 1641. What doth he Jabber thus for, of <hi>non en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,</hi> of things that never had a being? of a <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> in the <hi>Two Houſes,</hi> which they never had, which neither Divine nor Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Lawes ever gave them? If I ſhould for once allow of his non-ſenſe, and lawleſs Aſſertions, yet I ſhould ſpoil his ſport there too; for their power in the Covenant was not ſo <hi>Legiſlative</hi> (I ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Presbyters <hi>canting</hi> tone) upon theſe grounds:</p>
            <p>The Proteſtation was made and taken in the preſence of all the Members of both Houſes, and giving their free conſent, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to eſtabliſhed Laws, had a Parliamentary authority (as it were) by His Majeſties deep ſilence (though nigh at hand) and thereby implying His tacit conſent to the doing of it, many thouſands took it, who yet utterly damned the wretched Covenant, deteſting it as the venome of hell, and not without juſt cauſe; But when by <hi>the Midwifery of Tumults and Armies,</hi> this devouring <hi>Brat</hi> of <hi>Abiram</hi> was brought forth, <note n="k" place="margin">

               <hi>All men know, That of 120 Peers of the kingdom, who were Temporal Peers before the Troubles, there were not above thirty left in the Lords Houſe, and in the Houſe of Commons about 200 of the principal

Or doth he think that the Kings ſilence, or his Proteſtation doth not <hi>adde</hi> or <hi>diminiſh the authority</hi> of the thing ſworn? But I muſt needs ſay indeed, <note n="l" place="margin">

(never doubted as to the validity of Authority) which you ſay was precarious; but Reſolves of the Houſe declare to have been Authoritative; The Votes, Reſolves, Orders and Ordinances of one or both Houſes do proclaim it; And the Priviledges of Parliament, That the King can take no notice of what is debated or voted, ordered or acted by them, until it be by themſelves formally preſented unto His Majeſty. And the very nature of Co-ordinate power (if the Doctor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it) with their Actings, in caſe of his abſence by minority, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, doth determine it; As to the exerciſe of it againſt the Kings conſent, I ſhall conclude nothing, but commend Mr.</hi> Prynn's Sovereign Power of Parliaments, <hi>to your ſerious ſtudy.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65994:36"/> Are the Two Houſes any better then the Kings Subjects?

            <p>As for the Proteſtation, I told you before, <hi>Silence gives conſent,</hi> and his Majeſties ſuffering ſuch a thing to be done by them, under his noſe, without a Prohibition, argues plainly his <hi>Tacit fiat</hi> to it, but yet proves not at all their ſuppoſed <hi>Legiſlative power,</hi> or Coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy in the ſame with their Head, nor the legality of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, without the Kings conſent.

               <hi>Bracton</hi> cited by the Reverend and Learned Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> tells us, <hi>Rex non habet parem in Regno ſuo,</hi> That the King hath not an equal in his kingdom; if not an <hi>Equal,</hi> then certainly <hi>no Superior,</hi> and ſo by conſequence ſhows the fiction of the <hi>Two Houſes Supremacy.</hi> There hath been ſo much already cited for the Supremacy of His Sacred Majeſty over all perſons in his Dominions, by Judge <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Diggs,</hi> and ſeveral others, that I need not trouble the Reader with any more repetitions thereof, but refer the disſatisfied to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Writings, and conclude this point with a word or two concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Oath of Supremacy, which every Member of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes muſt take before he ſits in the Houſe, or elſe according to Law, he ſtands a perſon to all intents and purpoſes, as if he had never bin elected or returned; which clearly declares the King to be the <hi>onely Supream</hi> Governor of this Realm, and of all other His Highneſs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Countreys, as well in all Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical things (or cauſes) as temporal, and ſo certainly by undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>over</hi> the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> in Parliament cauſes; For why was the excluſive Particle <hi>Onely</hi> inſerted, but to cut off all pretences of co-ordinacy or ſhare in the Regal Supremacy? <hi>And truly if he be Supream, there is neither Major, nor Superior,</hi> ſaith the Learned Lord <hi>Bridgeman</hi> in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65994:42"/> his Speech aforeſaid. Was this Oath (think you Mr. <hi>Crofton)</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, in the time of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and at their ſuit by <note n="*" place="margin">Eliz. c. 1</note> Act of Parliament made high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">5 Eliz. c. 1</note> for a ſubject to deny to take it, for to be evaded and treaſonably denied, &amp; the ſubject matter thereof aſcribed to the Subjects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who were fain to take it, ere they could have the leaſt colour or pretence, perjuriouſly to claim or uſurp it from the rightful owner, and this too by ſuch a <hi>Shadow of a Diſputant</hi> as your fanciful ſelf, who have armed your ſelf with ſo much confidence, to bawl out theſe ſeditious Aſſertions, which deſerve nothing elſe but the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Law for a confutation? Nothing but ſelf-condemnation? No other way left you to ſave your credit, but by writing ſedition, and throwing your poiſon'd darts of malice againſt your Superiors, for the pretended denial of that, the truth whereof your own whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ſelf is found to be a real diſclaimer? Cannot you <hi>dig a pit</hi> for another, but you muſt preſently <hi>fall into it</hi> your ſelf? Theſe ſhabbed courſes of yours, forces me to deal with you by a retortion, and ask you once again ſome more of your own queſtions, <hi>Where is, Sir, the Kings Prerogative over all perſons in all cauſes?
